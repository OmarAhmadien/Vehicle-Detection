# Vehicle Detection

Overview
--------------------
Our graduation project was about building (Advanced Driver Assistance System, ADAS) where we have used Convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for vehicle detection. We collected several datasets, tried diferent small architectures and trained it on Jetson Tk1 (Nividia Kit).
